<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The Maynarkh Dynasty Necrons is based on the NetEA and EpicUK Necron lists, but has undergone major changes due to
    the general Necron redesign.
</p>
<p>
    The Maynarkh Dynasty Necrons has received a new formation that can garrison from any objective; the Canoptec Swarm.
    The Canoptec Swarm (A Canoptec Spyder and Scarabs) is a way to get presence on the battlefield from the first
    activation, and can be useful holding ground or protecting teleporting portals. The list also has access to Necron
    Aircrafts.
