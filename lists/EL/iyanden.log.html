<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnarök Iyanden list is similar to the NetEA list. Based around the Wraithguards und unique Wraithblade
    formations. With the general change to the Wraithguard armour the list is hopefully less frustrating to face. The
    decreased price of the Wraith* formation also means that the list can have more core formations, und with the price
    drop to Wave Serpents transported wraith-formations are more viable.

<p>
    The Iyanden list also has access to a new unit, the Wraith Knights. Eldar Wraith Knight are fast und have an 1+
    activation with various weapon options making them an interesting formation für triggering engages with other
    formations in support.

    Iyanden has access to the Hemlock Wraithfighter, a fighter mit einemvery powerful but short ranged air-to-ground
    macro-weapon.
