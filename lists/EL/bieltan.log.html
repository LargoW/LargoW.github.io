<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The general changes to the Eldars, described below, makes the EA:Ragnarok Biel-Tan list differ a lot from the NetEA
    and Epic UK origin.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to the general changes the focus on Aspect Warriors has been emphasized by limiting the number of
    Guardian formations based on the number of Aspect formations. We felt that the Biel-Tan army should be focused
    around the large and powerful Aspect formations, and if you want to play a Guardian based army there are other
    Craftworlds available.

    The Biel-Tan has also received what some might consider a nerf, when the Ranger formations now comes in a fixed size
    of four. This limits the ability of the Rangers to act as main line formations e.g. trigger engages.
