<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnar√∂k Evil Sunz Speed Freeks Ork list is based on the NetEA and Epic UK versions of the list. The list is
    similar to the original with a few changes. One general Ork change that affects the power level of the Evil Sunz
    Speed Freeks is the nerf of Skorcha armor to 6+. It will make the choice of fast attack vehicles in your Warband
    more challenging! The Cult of Speed has been given the option to add Nob Warbikes as well as multiple Mekboy
    Speedstas to the formation for some extra punch in either assaults or shooting. The standard Fighta-Bommers has been
    replaced by one fighter (the Dakkajet) and one bomber (the Blitza-Bommer) to give the Flyboyz more options. Finally,
    the Fortress Mob now has the option to add Evil Sunz Oddboys with a number of unique equipment options for the
    Fortresses.
