<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnarök Clan Goffs Warhorde is based on the NetEA & Epic UK Ork War Horde lists. Most of the changes to the
    list are described as part of the general Ork changes.
</p>
<p>
    Apart from the general Ork changes, the Clan Goffs Warhorde has received one new formation: the Mekboy Dreadmob.
    This formation allows you to field a formation of the various AV walkers available to the Orks. Another small change
    has been made to the Warband. The Stormboy upgrade has been removed, so if you want Aufklärers in your Warband you will
    now have to use the Kommandos.
