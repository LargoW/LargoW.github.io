<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnarök Snakebite Clan Ork list is the EA:Ragnarök version of a Feral Ork list. We felt the existing Feral
    Orks lists were a bit one-sided and frustrating to play against, with an overload of large 4+ reinforced armor War
    Engines. We have done major changes compared to the Feral Ork list, while trying to keep the army theme intact and
    your existing models relevant.
</p>
<p>
    The Ork infantry has been changed for the Snakebite list into primitive versions of their more advanced brothers,
    with less advanced weaponry. A new transport has been introduced, the Gargantuan Squiggoth which is in between the
    Squiggoth and the Orkeosaurus in size. The Orkeosaurus has received a significant reduction to its armor, but is now
    faster. The Squiggoths also received the <i>'Ere we go</i> special rule for another 5cm extra movement during an
    assault. We want the Warbands to get into the fray faster, while at the same time not having an indestructible ride
    to hide in while they get there.
</p>
<p>
    The Steam Gargants has been changed a lot, and is no longer 0-1. They lost their anti-air attack and their
    very frustrating critical hit effect. They now use the standard critical effect for Ork Gargants; they catch fire.
    They use a shorter range version of the Soopagun and you can take a maximum of two Steam Gargants in a formation. We
    hope this will make the Steam Gargants more fun to play, less frustrating to face. You might also have to look for
    another formation to be your BTS, which was not the case in the Feral Ork list...
</p>
<p>
    A few new units has been introduced to give the list access to some shooting, like the Lobbas and the Squiggoth
    Supa-Lobba. Both units have indirect fire weapons which can be powerful, but require you to take a sustained fire
    action which is a challenge for the Orks.
</p>
<p>
    The Wyrdboy character has a slightly different function in the list. It is cheaper, but has shorter range. It also cannot be placed on War Engines, but must be allocated to an INF unit.
</p>
<h4>Version 1.0.beta-2</h4>
<p>
    Finding the list a bit too weak, we've introduced the following buffs to the list:
</p>
<p>
    The Brutes, which replace the Nobz, has gained the powerful "Rush 'em Ladz" special rule in exchange for their previous Befehlshaber special rule. This gives their formation a +1 bonus when attempting to take March actions, somewhat compensating for the army's slow speed when compared to other Ork lists. This made Junkatrukks slightly more expensive. A powerful choice even before, as it is the fastest formation, it is even better now as it has a Brute.
</p>
<p>
    The Gargantuan Squiggoth gained an additional MW attack in CC, an additional DC, and both it and the Orkeosaurus now have 3+ in CC.
