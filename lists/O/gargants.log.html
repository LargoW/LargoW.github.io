<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnarök Bad Moons Big Mob list is our version of a Gargant list. It has been built by the EA:Ragnarök team
    with some inspiration from the developmental NetEA list. The main focus of the list are the Gargants while the
    support formations are limited in size and power. Large and expensive war engines are always a challenge to balance,
    given the importance of activations in Epic. The Great and Mega Gargants are <i>God Machines</i> with <i>Split
    Fire</i> capable of shooting multiple formations per action which hopefully will help you earn your points back
    during the game. The standard Gargants are also cheaper than in other lists with more flexible weapon choices.

<p>
    The very flavourful <i>Push 'Em Harder Ladz</i> special rule has been borrowed from the NetEA list, so that you can
    set your Gargants on fire for some much needed extra speed. This is a way for the Gargats to reach their objectives
    or to get into engagement range, but make sure you don't die afterwards...

    A few new units has been introduced with the Bad Moons theme, such as the Flash Gitz (replacing Nobz) and the Meka
    Dread. The army also has access to the powerful but unreliable Rokkitzmob for some indirect fire.

    Playing a titan list can be challenging. Make sure to protect your Gargants from enemy engagements or crossfires,
    sometimes choosing the right support formations can be the key to victory. Try to find a good balance between the
    powerful Gargants and the support formations making sure your Gargants are not overwhelmed.
