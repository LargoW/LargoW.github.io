<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnarök Collegia Titanica is quite different from the NetEA and Epic UK Titan lists, and while inspired by both of them, it is not really based on either. Titans, and particularly the larger ones, have always been very problematic in Epic Armageddon, leading to them being very expensive to balance their enormous staying power. We have done a set of changes to all Titans across EA:Ragnarök, which affects the Collecia Titanica list a lot. The general changes to titans are described on the <a href="content/intro.html">about page</a> and has been applied to all titans in the list. This list does not attempt to incorporate the newly "discovered" Adeptus Titanicus Titans, those are intended to be included in the <i>Legiones Skitarii: Mars</i> list.

<p>
    Warlords and Reavers are split into two classes each, with very different weapon options. This was done to make the Warlord and Reaver easier to balance, and for thematic reasons. The Emperor Class Titans have been toned down, making them fit better at 3000 points.

<p>
    The list has access to some Questoris Knights from the Questoris Mechanicus list, and the support section is made up of Skitarii.
