<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnar√∂k 'Questoris Mechanicus' list is based on the developmental version found in the Net-EA forums, with some inspiration drawn from the Adeptus Titanicus E-UK list and the Knight World list. It is intended to cover pretty much every single 'modern' Imperial Knight that GW has released for 40k, under the assumption that these will eventually turn up in the Adeptus Titanicus game as models. So far that's been a pretty good bet, with even the Armigers showing up. At this point only the Dominus Knights are missing.

    One very important constraint when making a list with the new Knight models for Adeptus Titanicus is how large they are compared to older Epic models. For this reason most formations are no more than three Knights each, with several being only a single one. The army is intended to represent a mechanized force with some of the new Skitarii units as support.

    Like with the Knight World list, all Knights in QM are H-AVs, and have the same Ion Shield rules. They are not as hard as the Knights in the Adeptus Titanicus list, but have (among other things) the Stubborn and Chivalry rules to set them apart from the Knight World list. A key to making the list work on the battlefield is not to get too spread out, but take advantage of the very small footprint this army can have, and try to have them support each other.
