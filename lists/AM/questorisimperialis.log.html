<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnar√∂k 'Knight World' list is based on the Net-EA version of the list, with a lot of inspiration drawn from the Epic UK version, in particular the over all structure. With Questoris Mechanicus having replaced the old Knights in the fluff, the old Knight list is a bit of an odd-army-out, but we ended up retaining it mostly intact.

    H-AV: Having a list full of War Engines takes the Epic Armageddon rules well past its breaking point. There is simply no way to play the list according to the rules in any way that makes sense. There are simply too many edge cases and tedious details that have to be ignored in order to make the list work. For this reason, the H-AV type of unit was invented, which is meant to represent the "Knight" kind of unit. Half War Engine, half Armoured Vehicle, all fun. This obviously has major implications for how the list plays, but in our experience it all balances out fairly well.

<p>
    Ion Shield (x): The Ion Shield is basically the same as in Net-EA, but can't be used against CC attacks, and has a variable value that is meant to represent the varied skill of the pilots. This brings it in line with how the Ion Shield works in the modern fluff.

<h5>Additional nerfs, boosts & tweaks</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Retainer formations can now be taken for both Core and Support Households, giving the list a lot of additional flexibility. On the other hand the retainer formations can no longer take Inspiring Characters.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>The list inherits changes made to other lists, in particular the higher price for the Thunderbolts, and different stats and formation sizes for Howitzers and Heavy AA guns.</li>
</ul>
