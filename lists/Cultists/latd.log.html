<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnarök Lost and the Damned list is based on the developmental NetEA "Redux" version, splitting off all Imperial Guard formations into a separate list: Slaves to Darkness. The original Lost and the Damned list was very thematic, giving huge flexibility, but with rather too many ingredients that we think are better off in two separate lists.
</p>
<p>
    Restrictions: The biggest difference between the Redux list and the EA:Ragnarök version is the quite harsh restrictions on the number of each Daemon Engine formation, since playtest revealed that certain formations were quite spammable, with the list often becoming a War Engine list with some cultists thrown in. There is also the thematic restriction that the list cannot mix formations from factions that hates each other, which seems fitting given the "old school" theme of a list named after one of the iconic 40k/WHFB Chaos Books.
</p>
<p>
    Factions: All cultist formations are now undivided, making the list both more flexible but also makes it a lot easier to remember what each formation does. The prohibition of hated factions in the list also removes the the need for a animosity rule.

<h5>Additional nerfs, boosts & tweaks</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Like the Black Legion list, all the lesser daemons now cost 1 summoning point each, while the different lesser daemons are now more balanced with each other. The Lesser Daemon pool points are also slightly cheaper.</li>
    <li>Daemon Engines: The Lost and the Damned list inherits the changes made to various daemon engines made in the CSM lists, with the Cerberites as a new addition.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Version 1.0.beta-2</h4>
<p>
    The list inherits the changes done to the Slaves to Darkness and Death Guard lists.
