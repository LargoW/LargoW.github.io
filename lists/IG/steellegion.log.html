<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnarök Stahlegion army has seen a significant number of changes to make this fun but slightly underpowered list more versatile. These are collectively intended to open it up to more playstyles, as well as make certain less optimal formations worth taking.
</p>
<p>
    Formation sizes: One of the most important changes is that most Core formations are now smaller, making the army a lot less unwieldy, and certain very expensive but hard to price formations such as the Panzer Company and Artillery Company easier to fit in the list.
</p>
<p>
    Commissars and new special rule: Instead of scaling the number of Commissars to the points value of the list, Commissars are instead tied to Company size formations. This change was mostly made for thematic reasons, but also to simplify and streamline the list. As this impacts quite a lot of popular formations, the Commissars can also help their formations to activate with the "Courage, Discipline and Loyalty" special rule.
</p>
<p>
    Deathstrikes: The previously very extreme 0-1 Deathstrikes are now an ordinary Support choice, but has seen a points increase as well as a having their main weapons reduced in efficiency. This is an attempt to make it a more "normal" formation, which previously could have a very random impact on the game.
</p>


<h5>Additional nerfs, boosts & tweaks</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Valkyries: The Valkyries are no longer Aufklärer (which removes the potential for extreme Aufklärer screens when combined with Sturmtruppen) and their BP weapons are no longer Single Shot, but have 1BP instead of 2.</li>
    <li>Taurox: This transport choice has been added to the Storm Trooper Company to give them greater flexibility in how they deploy.</li>
    <li>Baneblades: Baneblades have long been a contested unit choice, and has always been seen as the inferior choice compared to the Shadowsword. Our solution to this is to make the Banebladegeschütz slightly longer in range (giving them the same range as the Shadowsword's main gun for better synergy when in a SHT Company) as well as increasing its FF value to 3+.</li>
    <li>Titans: Stahlegion being the "baseline" IG army, they got to retain their access to all Titans. They also inherit the global changes made to these. </li>
    <li>Rough Riders: No longer able to have Commissars, these are now Walker, and their attack has been consolidated to a single First Strike attack. </li>
    <li>Leman Russ: The Leman Russ Punisher has been added to the Leman Russ Platoon and the Leman Russ upgrade, both of which have also been reduced slightly in cost. </li>
    <li>Griffons: The Griffon has always been a very strange upgrade to many formations which from the start struggles with being too large. These are now instead an independent formation. </li>
    <li>Imperial Navy: The Stahlegion Inherits the cost increase to the Thunderbolts, as well as the changes to the Battleship which is now both cheaper and can arrive on the second turn instead of the third. </li>
    <li>Hellhounds: These were deemed to be slightly too cheap at 25 points each, and has seen their armour reduced to 5+. This also fits the unit thematically as they do have two giant Panzers of flammable liquid on the back! </li>
    <li>The Manticore is now an upgrade to the Artillery Company and Artillery Battery formations, as they are mostly the superior choice when compared to the Basilisk and Bombard. </li>
</ul>
<h5>Version 1.0.beta-2</h5>
<ul>
    <li>In line with changes made to Imperial Guard Super Heavy Panzers, the Super Heavy Panzer Company and Baneblades are slightly cheaper. Baneblades has only 4+ FF.</li>
</ul>
