<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnar√∂k Barans Siege Masters army is a major rework of the original Barans list by GW. The original is quite dependent on having extreme numbers of activations, which we've found to be a quite destructive playstyle.
</p>
<p>
    Since the list is inspired by WWI, we have tried to remove as much high-tech from the list as possible. Deathstrikes are still in the list as a formation upgrade, and the list can take Imperial Navy formations. It now has a Defense Laser formation as a replacement for the Shadowsword.
</p>
<p>
    Barans can easily field a list where all formations garrison, and for this reason it can place two garrisons where-ever they want, and have three formations on Overwatch from the start.
</p>
<p>
    To boost activations somewhat, certain formations are cheaper than other lists. Some formations can also be had in a variety of sizes, where the larger formations include a Commissar.
