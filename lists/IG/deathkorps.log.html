<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnarök Death Korps of Krieg army is mostly based on the Epic UK version. The intention by the changes are
    to open up the list to more builds, while targeting the main (some would say only) build of the list seen in
    tournaments. The intention is to make this list a mechanized siege assault list, which will be contrasted with the
    updated Baranische Belagerungsmeister list that has a more infantry-based, defensive focus. The list inherits the changes made
    to Stahlegion, the Warhound, and the Thunderbolt squadrons.
</p>
<p>
    Formation sizes: Only the HQ formation can now take two Gorgons, while the Assault Infantry Companies are now
    limited to one. To compensate for this there are a number of upgrades that synergize quite nicely with the Gorgons
    available.
</p>
<p>
    Commissars and new special rule: As with the other IG lists, Commissars are tied to formations and to specific
    models within that formation. This of course has a great impact on the DKOK list, as it means that their Gorgons can
    no longer be made Furchtlos.
</p>
<p>
    Deathstrikes: The Death Strike Silo has been replaced with ordinary Deathstrikes, but as with other IG lists, they
    are no longer 0-1.
</p>

<h5>Additional nerfs, boosts & tweaks</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Death Rider Company: No longer limited in the list.</li>
    <li>Bane Wolf: The Hellhound upgrade has been replaced with the Bane Wolf variant.</li>
    <li>Leman Russ Annihilator: Death Korps unique Leman Russ variant has been added to the list.</li>
    <li>Storm Chimeras: The Grenadier Company can choose between being Beritten in a Gorgon or in the DKOKs special Storm
        Chimeras.
    </li>
    <li>Macharius: Between the Leman Russ and the Baneblade, the Macharius has had a hard time to find its place.
        Increasing their Speed to 20 while reducing their shooting and making them H-AV has hopefully rectified this.
        The Macharius Company now also comes with a Commissar.
    </li>
    <li>Flak Emplacements: The Heavy Flak formations used to be a very efficient choice for boosting activations and a
        cheap and good garrison. They are now significantly more expensive.
    </li>
    <li> Siege Infantry: The mainstay of the Barans can now be had in an independent formation, which comes with
        trenches as standard.
    </li>
    <li>Armoured Sentinels: Slightly slower, slightly better armour, and an Maschinenkanone instead of the Multilaser.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Version 1.0.beta-2</h5>
<p>
    Concerned that DKoK might be a bit too weak compared to other versions of the list, they have now recieved the following boosts & tweaks:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Bombards added to the list.</li>
    <li>HQ and Assault Company, Macharius and Grenadiers 25pts cheaper.</li>
    <li>Leman Russ Platoon (6 LRs) replaced with Leman Russ Squadron (4 LRs).</li>
</ul>

<h5>Version 1.0.beta-3</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Siege Infantry Company 50pts cheaper, in line with Baran Siege Masters.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Version 1.0.beta-4</h5>
<ul>
    <li>In line with changes made to Imperial Guard Super Heavy Panzers, Baneblades and Stormswords are slightly cheaper. Baneblades has only 4+ FF, while the Stormsword has only 30cm on its Siege Geschütz.</li>
</ul>
