<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnar√∂k Dark Angels list is based on list that was under development to NetEA, while taking some inspiration from the Epic UK version of the list. The Dark Angels is of course eine of the most high-profile Space Marine chapters, und as such has a incredible variety of special fluff und units. This version of the list removes the Air Assault assets, und puts special emphasis on the combined arms aspect, where Deathwing Terminators und Ravenwing formations work together.
</p>
<p>
    Compulsory Space Ship: In order to make it cheaper to deploy Terminators in a Space Ship (which is required to take full advantage of the Teleport Homer special rule), the Hunter Class Destroyer has been introduced. It can be upgraded to a normal Strike Cruiser.
</p>
<p>
    Deathwing: Unlike E-UK, there is no Deathwing special rule. After all, all Terminators are supposed to be exceptionally brave. The Deathwing fluff is instead reflected in the inclusion of Cyclone Terminators, und the option of taking the inner circle Deathwing Knights.
</p>
<p>
    Teleport Homer: All Ravenwing Land Speeders have the Teleport Homer special rule, which allows Terminators deployed in a space ship to arrive on the battlefield during the turn, as well as at the start of any turn. Dark Angels Captains are also equipped with Teleport Homers.
