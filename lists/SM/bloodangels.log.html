    The EA:Ragnar√∂k Blood Angels list is inspired mainly by the NetEA list. The list is focused on engages while
    sacrificing long range shooting. It has a number of unique units and formations, including the iconic Death Company
    and Sanguinary Guards. The Blood Angels chapter also has access to the Stormraven transport, which has been designed
    as a skimmer with the <i>planetfall</i> special ability. This opens up for a unique playstyle where you can drop
    formations from space with very high mobility on the ground. To further cater to this style of play the Blood Angels
    has been given access to a cheaper spaceship, the Vanguard Class Light Cruiser. As we wanted the Stormraven to be
    the main "air-transport", even thou it is not a true aircraft, Blood Angels do not have access to Thunderhawks.

    The Death Company is cheaper than in other lists, and has been designed to be the vanguard of the Blood Angels army.
    They can not be transported. Instead, they either garrison ahead of the main force or gets inserted via Drop Pods.

    The Blood Angels list is well suited to an aggressive play-style with a mix of fast ground-based formations and
    space insertions. Make sure you close in on the enemy fast to compensate for the lack of long range firepower.
