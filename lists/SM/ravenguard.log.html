<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnar√∂k Raven Guard list is loosely based on the NetEA version, but with major changes to many of the units.
    The guerrilla style warfare of the Raven Guard chapter is reflected by small, deadly but fragile infantry based
    formations. The list is extremely flexible when it comes to deployment options. The <i>Expert Reconnaissance</i>
    rule given to the Raven Guard Scouts allows for more accurate space drops and safer teleports. The list also has
    access to air insertions using Storm Eagles, that replaces the standard Thunderhawk. The downside is that the list
    lost access to all Space Marine support tanks and has to rely on alternative sources for firepower.

<p>
    To make up for the loss of firepower the list has been given access to the Land Speeder Tempest, that carries
    heavier armour and weapons compared to other Land Speeder variants. The Terminator formation also has the option to
    take Cyclone Raketenwerfer, trading assault capabilities for better shooting.
</p>
<p>
    Both Sternguard and Vanguard formations has been kept from the NetEA original, but has undergone major changes.
    Vanguards are close combat specialists with Macro-weapons and Sternguards fire-fight specialists with <i>Sniper</i>
    firefight. Both formations also has the <i>Lightning Charge</i> (first strike when the formation initiated an
    assault) special rule.

    The small but deadly formations of the Raven Guard can be used to great effect when controlling the flow of the
    battle. But when taking casualties they can quickly be reduced to a point where they can not threaten even the
    weakest enemy formations. The list can have a high activation count, but make sure you have a plan for how to deal
    with large enemy formations, and consider adding an upgrade or two to boost formation sizes.
