<h2>Fog of War</h2>
<h3>Setup</h3>
<p>Same as the normal Epic Tournament Scenario.</p>
<h3>Pre-game discussion</h3>
<p>Same as the normal Epic Tournament Scenario.</p>
<h3>Place Objective Markers</h3>
<p>Same as in the Epic Tournament Scenario, but the Blitz objective must be placed at least 15cm from any corner, and the remaining two
    objectives must be set up at least 15cm from any board edge.</p>
<h3>Setup Spacecraft & Garrisons</h3>
<p>Same as the normal Epic Tournament Scenario.</p>
<h3>Set-up Remaining Formations</h3>
<p>Same as the normal Epic Tournament Scenario.</p>
<h3>Victory Conditions</h3>
<p>If at the end of any turn a player has achieved 4 or more Victory Conditions then the opponent then the game ends,
    compare victory conditions and work out tournament/battle points.</p>
<p>You must check to see if either player has won at the end of the third and fourth game turns. If neither player has
    won at the end of the fourth turn then the ‘tiebreaker’ rule is used to determine the winner.</p>
<p>Each player is trying to achieve five things known as goals. You win if you have achieved two of these goals in the
    End Phase of turns three or four, and you have achieved more goals than your opponent. The five goals are:
    Blitzkrieg, Break Their Spirit, Defend the Flag, Take and Hold, and Fog of War.</p>
<dl>
    <dt>Blitzkrieg</dt>
    <dd>You achieve this goal by capturing the objective that was set up on the opponent’s table edge at the start of
        the game (ie, the first objective each player set up).
    </dd>
    <dt>Break Their Spirit</dt>
    <dd>You achieve this goal by destroying (not breaking) the formation worth the most points in the opposing army. If
        several formations are tied for the most points, you achieve this goal by destroying any one of them.
    </dd>
    <dt>Defend the Flag</dt>
    <dd>You achieve this goal if you control all three objectives in your half of the table.</dd>
    <dt>Take and Hold</dt>
    <dd>You achieve this goal by capturing a total of two objectives in your opponent’s half of the table.</dd>
    <dt>Fog of War</dt>
    <dd>At the start of the battle, each player writes down an objective on a piece of paper. If the player manages to achieve that objective it is counted as two objectives instead of one.</dd>
    <dd>Players only have to reveal which objective they picked at the end of the third or fourth turn if they won, or if it made the difference between winning and losing.</dd>
